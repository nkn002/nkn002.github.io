I am currently a student at the College of William and Mary. I am also fortunate to be supervised by [Hy Truong Son](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~hytruongson/), [Anh Totti Nguyen](https://anhnguyen.me/research/) and [Thiago Serra](https://tippie.uiowa.edu/people/thiago-serra). My research focuses on applications of LLMs in the domains of Healthcare, and quantifying and understanding the limitations and biases of LLMs and VLMs.

1. **LLMs in Healthcare**: I worked on improving speech summarization with LLM synthetic data ([link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.15888)) and leveraging LLM reasoning to enhance the interpretability and performance of medical sentiment analysis ([link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21054)).
2. **Vision-Language Models**: Some tasks are simple for humans yet hard for VLMs. My current project aims to quantify, understand and close this performance gap.
